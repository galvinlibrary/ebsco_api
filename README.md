# ebsco_api

1. call api
2. remove ns
3. xml to csv
4. combine csv


Lots of work to do still.  have to manually create folders.  need to get hit counts in order to know how many api calls to make for each journal.  need to make dictionary files.  need to create some functions for the big code blocks in the xml to csv.
